# Math-Hotkey
**Supports: 64-Bit Machines, Windows 10**

Ever been writing in a document or playing a game and have a math problem that you already had typed out and so didn't wanna pull out your calculator to type it in again?<br>
Using the keys `control`+`shift`+`e` will take any selected text and attempt to evaluate it as a math problem.<Br>
This program I made will check text you have selected, and evaluate it as a math problem. It emulates the hotkey `control`+`x` to copy text, so wherever you can use that, you can use this!
  
Worried about the fact it uses the computer's cliboard? Don't be! Anything you have copied before you run the hotkey will be saved and then put back into your pc's clipboard after the math is done.

## Installation
Download `MathHotkey.exe` in the executeable folder. Run the file and a new icon will be added to your system tray, from then you can use the hotkey where it is available.
