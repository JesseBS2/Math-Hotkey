# Math-Hotkey
Ever been writing in a document or playing a game and have a math problem that you already had typed out and so didn't wanna pull out your calculator to type it in again? 
This program I made will check text you have selected, and evaluate it as a math problem. It uses the hotkey `control`+`x` to copy text, so wherever you can use that, you can use this!

Worried about the fact it uses the computer's cliboard? Don't be! Anything you have copied before you run the hotkey will be saved and then put back into your pc's clipboard after the math is done.

This is one I've come across quite a few times myself, needing to know how many blocks to get to fill in a given space

Another example of math that is already typed out, but normally can't be calculated unless using some external application
